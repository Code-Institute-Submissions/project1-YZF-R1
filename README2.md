Project 1: YZF-R1 Japanese Mastercraft

I was asked to create a website with a number of webpages.
I was given a choice of creating a website for a fictitious band or else creating
my own website with my own idea. I chose the latter and I created a website for 
a Motorbike Shop. 

Initially I created a website about a Farm Shop that was to form the foundations for my second project.
After some careful consideration I decided to make a clear distinction between the two projects and therefore 
created the Japanese Mastercraft site.


UX:
THis Website was created for a fictitious client. They are the owners of a motorcycle shop and are 
looking to project themselves to a wider audience  and create a strong and identifiable online presence.
They are looking to increase their overall sales and have asked me to help them on this journey by developing
a site for them that will who they are and what they are about.


Features:
I started on my journey for this site with a blank canvas. I am new to web development so I modelled the site
on a number of walkthrough projects that I studied.

I decided on a fairly standard site layout with a large colourful background image that clearly identifies
the nature of the business that my client is involved in.

The navbar comprises of 3 clickable headings that open links to different HTML pages. These reduce to 2 headings 
on medium sized media and reduce to a dropdown burger(mentioned below) for small media.
These pages center around the index.html(main page) which is the home page and is the initial page to open on 
entering the site. It is followed by the products.html page which briefly oulines the companies wares along 
with the about.html page which gives some  background information on the client.

I added a burger dropdown menu(from bootstrap) to the site which is only active in the smaller media sizes. It contains the 
contents of the navbar and links to a login modal. This modal isn't fully functional and isn't linked to the backend.
I also added a similar "join us" modal that doesn't link(as yet) to the backend either.

In the quotes section I added some brief quotes/reviews from clients accompanied by their profile pictures and name of their
social media platforms. 

In the features section at the base of the page I added 3 columns of text that collapse vertically for smaller media sizes.



Features left to implement:
The login and join us modal both have to be connected to the back end. I hope to add a contact us section and to expand the 
product listings to display their prices along with a brief description.


Technologies used:
I used stylesheets from libraries including bootstrap that are linked in the head of the HTML pages.
links:
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css

Bootstrap is a grid based open source web framework that gives us templates for buttons, forms, and many other interface components.
These templates are CSS and HTML based and are on the front end in web development. Bootstrap helps make websites responsive across 
different sized devices. This is hugely important as what looks great on one device has the potential to look terrible on another.


JQuery is inserted into the footer of the HTML so that it loads after the HTML and CSS rules. It is basically simplified and concise 
Javascript code which I will be learning about in the next section.

I used cloud 9 to create and save my work and Github as an alternate location to store my work and make it available for others to view
and disect.



Testing:
I had to do a fair bit of testing to try to get the website to run smoothly over diferent sized devices. A crucial part of this was 
the use of the developer tool Inspect Element. This allowed me to test the website on various sized devices, make temporary adjustments
to colours, font sizes and the overall layout.


Media:

conclusion:
This section has certainly been a learning curve. There's been a lot to take on board and digest. I had some significant 
adjustments to make at the end of this project as I changed the theme of the site completely. Thankfully I did this 
with relative ease as I knew where to look in the code to implement these changes.

Acknowledgements:
I would like to thank my mentor Nishant for his help, encouragement and patience.
